	<description>In base Rimworld, children do not gain growth score whilst in deathrest; this avoids an exploit in which a player could bring a child up to a maximum learning need and then suspend it whilst they deathrest, gaining high growth for no effort. However, this fix has the side-effect of disadvantaging deathresting children, as there are many days where they could be learning, but are instead forced to undertake deathrest. 

This mod avoids both problems by pausing biological age progression whilst a pawn deathrests. This change allows children to have the same total time to increase their growth score, while remaining thematically consistent.
